    "text": "Data Description\nI am using the fire incident data available at the CAL FIRE website. CalFIRE (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection) is California’s state agency responsible for fire protection in State Responsibility Areas (SRAs), which include over 31 million acres of wildlands and areas with significant natural resources. CAL FIRE also provides emergency services in cooperation with local governments and handles forest management, fire prevention, and resource protection.\nAll of the agency’s information comes from the firelines and must be approved by the Incident Commander in charge of managing the incident prior to release. The data then gets compiled by their staff and published in their website for the public to access. In their incidents page, there is a Current Emergency Incidents section where it shows fire related information such as evacuation orders and acres burned through Earthstar Geographics powered by Esri, Genasys and Perimeter. However, since I needed the whole historical fire data set to perform my analysis , I collected the CSV file, they offered.\nThe main reasons why they collect the fire incident data includes fastening fire responsiveness, prevention of future fires, to inform the public through statistics, and to create an incentive for more funding towards fire prevention.\n\nData Limitations\nCalFIRE makes it clear in their disclaimer that the data provided is intended for general reference rather than detailed scientific or emergency analysis. Therefore, important limitations must be considered when interpreting my model’s conclusions.\n(1) Bias in data collection: One possible source of bias is the fact that CalFIRE reportedly shared that a significant amount of small fires could go under reported, even more so if the incident burns less than 10 acres. Furthermore, another source of bias can be explained by how I performed variable selection during the modeling process. Since I got the data before specifing my linear model, I must account for selection bias.\n(2) Variables Mismatches: The outcome variable in our linear model, acres_burned is the only variable being used in my analysis to define the severity of the fire incidents. However, we are excluding so many crucial variables that influence a fire severity in the real-world such as structures destroyed, rural/urban differences, fire escalation, lack of firefighters, area accessibility, injuries, fatalities, more expensive/cheaper neighborhoods, total loss, and more. Plus, the variables incident_season and incident_county are very broad. I am not accounting for local weather, vegetation, source of fire, and human factors that could influence a fire behavior in the real-world.\n(3) Model Transferrability: My model is only accounting for fires in California in the past 12 years. Hence, the model might be inappropriate for other regions that present different weather, air humidity, terrain, biodiversity, population demographics, government funding, and more."

    "text": "The devastating series of wildfires in Los Angeles County earlier this January inspired me to focus my final project on analyzing fire incidents across California counties over the past 12 years. This project aims to explore key relationships between predictor variables and the severity of wildfires, measured by acres burned, while also developing a predictive model to anticipate future fire impacts. In addition to model-building, I’m investigating several important inference questions that reflect real-world concerns:\n\nDoes the severity of a wildfire depend on the season of the year?\nAre wildfires in California worsening over time in terms of severity?\nAre there specific counties in California where wildfires are more likely to occur?\n\nBy addressing these questions, I hope to better understand the patterns behind wildfire behavior—an understanding that could be crucial in shaping actuarial risk models and insurance strategies in the future.\nThis problem is especially compelling to me because I am majoring in Mathematics with a concentration in Actuarial Science and intend to pursue the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) track within the Property and Casualty insurance industry. As someone preparing for a career focused on analyzing risk and uncertainty, I believe that understanding the severity of fires in California, even if only measured by acres burned, is relevant for my career. Wildfires play a significant role in shaping Homeowners Insurance, both in terms of pricing and coverage availability. By studying this issue more deeply, I hope to gain insights that will one day allow me to develop more accurate predictive models and contribute to effective risk management strategies. Understanding these patterns isn’t just academically interesting—it directly aligns with my long-term professional goals of helping insurers and communities better prepare for and respond to natural disasters.\nNote: For context, it is important to note the key difference between the severity being measured in this project and the severity in insurance rate making.\nIn this project, we are defining severity as how destructive a fire is based on the length it impacted, disregarding other factors:\n\\[\n\\text{Severity} = \\text{Amount of acres burned by a fire}\\\n\\]\nIn insurance rate making, severity refers to the average cost of a claim:\n\\[\n\\text{Severity} = \\frac{\\text{Total Loss Amount}}{\\text{Number of Claims}}\n\\]\nOBS: This clarification will definitely be helpful for actuaries and insurance professionals."
