    "text": "Data Description\nI am using the fire incident data available at the CAL FIRE website. CalFIRE (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection) is California’s state agency responsible for fire protection in State Responsibility Areas (SRAs), which include over 31 million acres of wildlands and areas with significant natural resources. CAL FIRE also provides emergency services in cooperation with local governments and handles forest management, fire prevention, and resource protection.\nAll of the agency’s information comes from the firelines and must be approved by the Incident Commander in charge of managing the incident prior to release. The data then gets compiled by their staff and published in their website for the public to access. In their incidents page, there is a Current Emergency Incidents section where it shows fire related information such as evacuation orders and acres burned through Earthstar Geographics powered by Esri, Genasys and Perimeter. However, since I needed the whole historical fire data set to perform my analysis , I collected the CSV file, they offered.\nThe main reasons why they collect the fire incident data includes fastening fire responsiveness, prevention of future fires, to inform the public through statistics, and to create an incentive for more funding towards fire prevention.\n\nData Limitations\nCalFIRE makes it clear in their disclaimer that the data provided is intended for general reference rather than detailed scientific or emergency analysis. Therefore, important limitations must be considered when interpreting my model’s conclusions.\n(1) Bias in data collection: One possible source of bias is the fact that CalFIRE reportedly shared that a significant amount of small fires could go under reported, even more so if the incident burns less than 10 acres. Furthermore, another source of bias can be explained by how I performed variable selection during the modeling process. Since I got the data before specifing my linear model, I must account for selection bias.\n(2) Variables Mismatches: The outcome variable in our linear model, acres_burned is the only variable being used in my analysis to define the severity of the fire incidents. However, we are excluding so many crucial variables that influence a fire severity in the real-world such as structures destroyed, rural/urban differences, fire escalation, lack of firefighters, area accessibility, injuries, fatalities, more expensive/cheaper neighborhoods, total loss, and more. Plus, the variables incident_season and incident_county are very broad. I am not accounting for local weather, vegetation, source of fire, and human factors that could influence a fire behavior in the real-world.\n(3) Model Transferrability: My model is only accounting for fires in California in the past 12 years. Hence, the model might be inappropriate for other regions that present different weather, air humidity, terrain, biodiversity, population demographics, government funding, and more."

    "text": "Data Wrangling\n#Data Clean Up\nFirst of all, I must make sure this data set contains only historical fire data. CalFIRE predominantly oversee fire incidents but not exclusively. After some digging in incident_type, there were indeed two incidents reported as flood and one as earthquake. Hence, let’s remove them from our original data set and change the updated data set name for good practice.\n\nfire_data &lt;- original_fire %&gt;%\n  filter(!incident_type %in% c(\"Flood\", \"Earthquake\"))\n\nWe should be worried about the observations that have missing data for the incident_type variable because what if they are not a fire incident. Hence, I made sure to check the incident_name manually to ensure all of the observations in our data set were only fire incidents.\nFurthermore, since acres burned will be our response variable we must make sure we are only looking at fires that were already contained so that we know exactly how many acres were affected. Hence, the chunk below removes all the fire incidents that were still active as of May 2025. In this case, there were only three.\n\nfire_data &lt;- original_fire %&gt;%\n  filter(!is_active %in% c(\"Y\"))\n\n#Variable Selection\nNow, let’s take a look at the first 30 rows in the original data set provided by CalFIRE and understand the variables we are working with:\n\nhead(original_fire, 30)\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 23\n   incident_name  incident_is_final incident_date_last_u…¹ incident_date_created\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dttm&gt;                 &lt;dttm&gt;               \n 1 Bridge Fire    Y                 2018-01-09 13:46:00    2017-10-31 11:22:00  \n 2 Pala Fire      Y                 2020-09-16 14:07:35    2009-05-24 14:56:00  \n 3 River Fire     Y                 2022-10-24 11:39:23    2013-02-24 08:16:00  \n 4 Fawnskin Fire  Y                 2013-04-22 09:00:00    2013-04-20 17:30:00  \n 5 Gold Fire      Y                 2013-05-01 07:00:00    2013-04-30 12:59:00  \n 6 Panther Fire   Y                 2022-10-24 11:40:03    2013-05-01 09:12:00  \n 7 Silverado Fire Y                 2013-05-01 17:15:00    2013-04-30 23:44:00  \n 8 Yellow Fire    Y                 2013-05-03 06:15:00    2013-05-01 02:01:00  \n 9 Summit Fire    Y                 2022-10-24 11:40:42    2013-05-01 12:38:00  \n10 Tres Pinos Fi… Y                 2013-05-03 18:45:00    2013-05-03 11:42:00  \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​incident_date_last_update\n# ℹ 19 more variables: incident_administrative_unit &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   incident_administrative_unit_url &lt;lgl&gt;, incident_county &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   incident_location &lt;chr&gt;, incident_acres_burned &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   incident_containment &lt;dbl&gt;, incident_control &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   incident_cooperating_agencies &lt;chr&gt;, incident_longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nWe can see there are some unnecessary variables that can be removed from this data set because they will be irrelevant to our analysis. More specifically:\n\nincident_is_final - I am only considering incidents that are final because days active is one of my predictor variables. Plus, there were only 3 fires that were active on the data set. They will be deleted in the chunks below.\nincident_date_last_update - Irrelevant for our analysis since fires considered are final.\nincident_county - I modified this variable to only include counties in California.\nincident_location - This column described the location of the fire, some cells described which freeway, other cells described off of which street, other cells gave more estimations (i.e. near the 4500 block of Chuckwagon Drive, Copperopolis). It would be very ambitious to consider this a variable.\nincident_containment - This column showed what percentage of the fire was contained, while 2794 out of 2864 were contained, the data showed 70 cells with missing data or less than 100% contained. However, this seems to be a variable that was not updated because all of those 70 fires were extinguished already, hence they have to have been contained.\nincident_longitude and incident_latitude - Irrelevant for our analysis, no need for the location of the fire to be this specific.\nincident_type - The original data set did contain two floods and one earthquake incidents that I deleted for the polished excel file. Also, this variable differentiated fire from wildfire. Since we are not getting that specific I decided to drop this variable as well.\nincident_date_extinguished and incident_dateonly_extinguished - I was going to use this variable to calculate for how long each fire has been active. However, after some digging, I found multiple inconsistencies in the reportedly duration of the fire. Some of them showed that they were active for more than a year! Plus, I found that if we consider incident_date_extinguished , near half of the fires supposedly were active for more than 60 days, which does not sound reasonable at all. However, I did not lose hope with this data set from CalFIRE because the incident_date_created has been precisely accurate with every fire I researched on my own. Similarly with acres_burned .\nincident_date_created - Repetitive, we already have incident_dateonly_created.\nincident_administrative_unit , incident_administrative_unit_url, incident_control , incident_cooperating_agencies , incident_id , incident_url, calfire_incident , notification_desired - Irrelevant for our analysis.\n\nLet’s remove those variables now,\n\nfire_data &lt;- fire_data %&gt;%\n  select(-c(incident_is_final, incident_date_last_update, incident_location, incident_containment, incident_longitude, incident_latitude, incident_type, incident_date_extinguished, incident_dateonly_extinguished, incident_administrative_unit, incident_administrative_unit_url, incident_control, incident_cooperating_agencies, incident_id , incident_url, calfire_incident, notification_desired, incident_date_created, is_active))\n\n# To remove all the variables we deemed unecessary.\n\nNow that we have removed those unnecessary variables. Let’s extract other interesting variables from the given ones and perhaps change their names for our data set to look more professional. For example, from the date the fire was created we can extract the year, the month, and the season that fire originated. Hence, here are the variables we are generating from the given data:\n\nyear - what year the fire originated.\nmonth - what month the fire originated in numeric form.\nseason - what was the season when the fire originated.\nmulti_county - whether the fire has affected more than one county.\nis_complex - a fire is called a “complex” when two or more fires burn in the same general area and are managed under a single incident command or unified command.\n\n\nfire_data &lt;- fire_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = year(incident_dateonly_created),\n    month = month(incident_dateonly_created),\n    season = case_when(\n      month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ \"Winter\",\n      month %in% c(3, 4, 5)  ~ \"Spring\",\n      month %in% c(6, 7, 8)  ~ \"Summer\",\n      month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ \"Fall\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    multi_county = grepl(\",\", incident_county),\n    \n    is_complex = grepl(\"Complex\", incident_name)\n  )\n\nNow, let’s change some of the variables names for :\n\nfire_data &lt;- fire_data %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    name = incident_name,\n    county = incident_county,\n    severity = incident_acres_burned,\n    date = incident_dateonly_created,\n  )\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at our updated and clean data set. We are now one step closer to perform our Analysis.\n\nhead(fire_data, 30)\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 9\n   name    county severity date        year month season multi_county is_complex\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;        &lt;lgl&gt;     \n 1 Bridge… Shasta       37 2017-10-31  2017    10 Fall   FALSE        FALSE     \n 2 Pala F… San D…      122 2009-05-24  2009     5 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 3 River … Inyo        407 2013-02-24  2013     2 Winter FALSE        FALSE     \n 4 Fawnsk… San B…       30 2013-04-20  2013     4 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 5 Gold F… Madera      274 2013-04-30  2013     4 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 6 Panthe… Tehama     6896 2013-05-01  2013     5 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 7 Silver… Napa         75 2013-04-30  2013     4 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 8 Yellow… Sonoma      125 2013-05-01  2013     5 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n 9 Summit… River…     2956 2013-05-01  2013     5 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n10 Tres P… San B…      354 2013-05-03  2013     5 Spring FALSE        FALSE     \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n\n#Data Split\nLastly, we should split the data into a training set (fire_train) and test set (fire_test).

More precisely, 52 reports missing for amount of acres burned and 10 reports missing for which county the fire happened, which represents 1.82% and 0.35% of those variables respectively total data. Therefore, this is a good sign that our data set has barely any data missing. We could even visualize how insignificant the missingness is related to our overall data,\n\nvis_miss(fire_data, cluster = TRUE, sort_miss = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, approximately 2% of the data had missing values. I opted to remove those rows. This avoids the need for potentially biased imputation of the target variable, with methods such as Mean/Median/Mode, linear model, or softImpute. The small proportion of missing data will not significantly impact our overall analysis.\n\nfire_data &lt;- fire_data %&gt;% \n  drop_na()\n\n\n    fire_data |&gt;\n      miss_var_summary()\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  variable     n_miss pct_miss\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 name              0        0\n2 county            0        0\n3 severity          0        0\n4 date              0        0\n5 year              0        0\n6 month             0        0\n7 season            0        0\n8 multi_county      0        0\n9 is_complex        0        0\n\n\n#Exploring Variables\n\nsummary(fire_train)\n\n     name              county             severity            date           \n Length:2288        Length:2288        Min.   :      0   Min.   :1969-12-31  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:     30   1st Qu.:2017-07-31  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :     83   Median :2019-10-10  \n                                       Mean   :   4468   Mean   :2020-02-01  \n                                       3rd Qu.:    367   3rd Qu.:2023-08-01  \n                                       Max.   :1032648   Max.   :2025-05-02  \n                                       NA's   :47                            \n      year          month           season          multi_county   \n Min.   :1969   Min.   : 1.000   Length:2288        Mode :logical  \n 1st Qu.:2017   1st Qu.: 6.000   Class :character   FALSE:2245     \n Median :2019   Median : 7.000   Mode  :character   TRUE :43       \n Mean   :2020   Mean   : 7.181                                     \n 3rd Qu.:2023   3rd Qu.: 8.000                                     \n Max.   :2025   Max.   :12.000                                     \n                                                                   \n is_complex     \n Mode :logical  \n FALSE:2245     \n TRUE :43       \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\n\nggplot(data = fire_train, mapping = aes(x = overall)\n       ) +\n  \n  geom_histogram(center = 1.125, binwidth = 0.25)\n\n\nfire_train |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    num_total = n(),\n    mean = mean(fire_train$severity),\n    sd = sd(fire_train$severity),\n    min = min(fire_train$severity),\n    Q1 = quantile(fire_train$severity, 0.25),\n    median = median(fire_train$severity),\n    Q3 = quantile(fire_train$severity, 0.75),\n    max = max(fire_train$severity)\n    )\n\n\nggplot(fire_data, aes(x = severity)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = \"darkred\", color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  labs(title = \"Log-Scale Distribution of Fire Severity\", x = \"Log(Acres Burned)\", y = \"Number of Fires\") +\n  theme_minimal()"
